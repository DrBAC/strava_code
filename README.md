Welcome to the **Data Analysis of Sports** repository! 🏃‍♂️🚴‍♀️🚶‍♂️

This project explores and visualizes data from various sports activities such as cycling, running, and walking. It aims to uncover trends, performance insights, and actionable metrics using Python and modern data analysis tools.


## Overall Plan

- __Explore & munge data from extracted datasource__
- __Build a db, build the ETL, and insert data into local database__
- __Build Dash App to allow interrogation of training data, leveraging local db connection__
- __Cross correlate with Apple Health data and Weather data__
- __Explore wider data set to try and understand training e.g.:__
   - what does good performance look like (for me)?
   - do I perform better on warmer days?
   - do I perform better after significant rests?
   - can I automatically classify some training - what features enable this?

_I will be removing any personally identifiable information in here before anything is shared, but I will share the code I develop/use to do that_
